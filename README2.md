`A Pie` is a minimalistic HTTP server tailored for JSON API

## Description

HTTP APIs should be easy to create. APIs should be as simple as possible, without all the boilerplate code that handles HTTP housekeeping. `apie` strives to make API development easy.

For example, an API that handles adding A and B should be as simple as:
```js
export function({ a, b }) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Any boilerplate code will only slow down development and make software less maintainable.
